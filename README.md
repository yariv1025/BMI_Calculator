# Test-Driven Development Project

Test-driven development is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:
requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved so that the tests pass.
___
In our project, we worked on TDD's attitude.
First, we coded the test cases for each software and then we coded the BMI software and the Bubble Sort software.

## BMI  Calculator Test's
Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults.
It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (Kg/m^2). 

## Buuble Sort Test's
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort.
Bubble sort can be practical if the input is in mostly sorted order with some out-of-order elements nearly in position
